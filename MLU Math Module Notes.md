## Vector/Matrix

### Representation

A data point is usually represented as a **column** vector

A matrix is usually a collection of column vectors

### Norms

Norms is a measurement of distance in some of sort.

* L2-Norm: square root of squared sum 
* Lp-Norm: p root of p sum of absolutes, generalization of L2 
* L1-Norm: sum of all absolute value of elements 
* Linfinity-Norm: the largest absolute value of element 
* L0-Norm: number of non-zero element, not a real norm, more of a measure of sparsity 

For Lp-Norm: Lp(v) <= Lq(v) whenever p > q
